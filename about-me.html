      <h1>Hi there</h1>
      <p>I'm Andrea.</p>
      <p>I'm a Junior Programmer and ex marketing and advertising professional by trade. I make fun things, like this website, apps and programs, with code.</p>
      <p>In my spare time you'll find me watching AFL, going to the beach, playing mixed netball, dancing to live music gigs, bingeing a season of Ru Paul's Drag Race or discovering a new craft sour.</p>
      <p>Whether I'm on the clock or out and about I love uncovering patterns, understanding how people think and making the world a fairer place for everyone to live.</p>

  <!-- The Journey-->
  <section class="journey">

    <h1>The Journey</h1>

    <section class="right-about-box">
      <h2>Baby steps</h2>
      <p class="fade-in">I've been curious about the world for as long as I can remember. My first word was "more" ... read into that what you will. </p>
    </section>

    <section class="left-about-box">
      <h2>Inspired by Gruen Transfer</h2>
      <p class="fade-in">As a teenager I was obsessed with the ABC tv show Gruen. I loved how ads could make you feel something with so few words, or so little time. </p>
      <p class="fade-in">I took this passion and completed a Commerce Degree at UWA majoring in Marketing, Economics and Business Law.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="right-about-box">
      <h2>Got a big girl job</h2>
      <p class="fade-in">I was lucky enough to snag an internship, and later a full time job, at one of the big ad agencies in Perth - Meerkats (now called Wunderman Thompson).</p>
      <p class="fade-in">I learnt heaps there about project management, the creative industry and most importantly the art of diplomacy.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="fade-in">(Remember how I loved Gruen, while working at Meerkats and volunteering with YoungBloods WA I also worked on an ad for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/8QXMUmJ4qf/" target="_blank">"The Pitch" section of the show and won it!</a>)</p>
    </section>

    <section class="left-about-box">
      <h2>Ballet came pirouette-ing into my life</h2>
      <p class="fade-in">I took a quick 3 month contract at West Australian Ballet in the Marketing Team.</p>
      <p class="fade-in">Although I kind of fell in love with it and was there for the next 5 years.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="right-about-box">
      <h2>"More" came back into my life</h2>
      <p class="fade-in">Around the time COVID-19 hit I started feeling a bit restless at work.</p>
      <p class="fade-in">I got excited by the potential and challenge of learning something new. So I looked into Programming.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="left-about-box">
      <h2>for (int i=0 ; &lt; career.Length ; i++)</h2>
      <p class="fade-in">I completed a Cert IV in Programming and made some fun stuff - including this site.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="right-about-box">
      <h2>Work in progress</h2>
      <p class="fade-in">Well that's it so far but just wait, there's way more to come!</p>
